## About 
I am a software developer with a background in theoretical linguistics. I am particularly interested in the relationship between (natural and programming) languages and mathematical structures.


## Key projects
- [PyEpiDoc](https://github.com/rsdc2/PyEpiDoc): a Python library for manipulating and querying TEI EpiDoc files: TEI is a format for richly encoding information about written text.
- [qsharp-math-utils](https://github.com/rsdc2/qsharp-math-utils): a library written in Q# for manipulating mathematical structures important in quantum computing
- [syntax-treebank-annotator](https://github.com/rsdc2/syntax-treebank-annotator): an annotation environment for natural langauge syntax

## Academic interests

- Linguistics and NLP
- Category theory
- Quantum computing
- Programming language typology
